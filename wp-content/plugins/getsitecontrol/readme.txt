- **Autoresponder**: create custom messages that will be automatically emailed to those who have subscribed to your newsletter, completed a survey or used your contact form.
- **Survey logic and branching**: use advanced survey logic to direct respondents through different paths in a survey. Automatically send them to a certain question or to the end of the survey based on the answer they select.
